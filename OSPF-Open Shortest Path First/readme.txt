Router Configuration Guide

In FRRouting, you would run:
router# configure terminal
router(config)# interface port_BOST
router(config-if)# ip address 10.0.1.2/24

During router configuration, selecting an appropriate IP address is crucial for subsequent OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) configuration. Ensure that the chosen IP address not only functions correctly but also facilitates optimal OSPF setup.

Issue Description
1. The current router's IP address may not be ideal for OSPF configuration.

Solution Steps
1. Assess Network Topology: Evaluate the network topology to determine the best IP address range. Consider subnet structures and connectivity requirements.

2. Choose an Adequate IP Address: Based on the network assessment, select an appropriate, unassigned IP address. Ensure that this address not only maintains network connectivity but also provides a solid foundation for OSPF configuration.

3. Modify Configuration: Access the router's configuration interface and change the current IP address to the selected suitable address.

4. Test Connectivity: Verify that the modified IP address does not disrupt connectivity with other devices. Conduct ping tests or other network connectivity tests to confirm.

Next Steps
1. Once these steps are completed, your router should be configured with the optimal IP address for OSPF setup. Proceed with configuring the OSPF protocol to achieve more flexible and automated routing management.

OSPF Neighbor Establishment and Cost Adjustment Guide

After configuring the IP addresses for each node router, it's essential to establish OSPF neighbor relationships and adjust cost values. During this process, it's important to continuously verify the accuracy of the executed commands, especially when pinging routers to obtain network latency.

Additionally, when connecting LOND to BOST, the network latency increases to 20ms. To optimize the OSPF path selection, the cost value is adjusted to 30.

Follow the steps below to establish OSPF connections and adjust cost values:

Establishing OSPF Connections

1. Connect to the router's command-line interface.

2. Enter the OSPF configuration mode:
   router(config)# router ospf <process-id>

3. Enable OSPF on the router's interfaces:
   router(config-router)# network <network-address> <wildcard-mask> area <area-id>

4. Verify OSPF neighbor relationships:
   router# show ip ospf neighbor

Adjusting OSPF Cost Values

1. Determine the link with increased latency (LOND to BOST).

2. Access the OSPF configuration mode:
   router(config)# router ospf <process-id>

3. Adjust the cost value for the specific interface:
   router(config-router)# interface <interface-type> <interface-number>
   router(config-if)# ip ospf cost <new-cost-value>

4. Verify the updated OSPF cost values:
   router# show ip ospf interface <interface-type> <interface-number>

Next Steps

1. Upon completion of these steps, OSPF neighbor relationships will be established, and the cost values will be optimized for efficient path selection. Continuously monitor network performance and adjust configurations as necessary.
